## 📖 Project Overview

Retail360 demonstrates how modern organizations can architect a secure, cloud-native data platform directly inside the Snowflake ecosystem. 

Rather than relying on fragmented stacks (e.g., Airflow for orchestration, dbt for transformations, Python servers for ML), Retail360 leverages Snowflake's native feature set. Raw transaction, customer, and inventory records arrive as unstructured or semi-structured files, process incrementally through validation checks, manage history perfectly via SCD2 logic, and finally surface inside Streamlit applications. Business users can view predictions or safely ask complex analytics questions in plain text using Cortex Analyst, which securely translates natural language requests into governed SQL queries.

### 🎯 Core Engineering Focus
This repository serves as a showcase for production data engineering patterns, including:
*   Incremental ELT processing over batch re-computes.
*   Idempotent pipeline designs.
*   Defensive data validation structures (retaining good rows while isolating corrupted rows).
*   Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementations.

##⚡ Enterprise Design Principles

Retail360 was built using modern enterprise data engineering practices rather than traditional batch ETL.

###✅ Incremental Processing

Only newly ingested records are processed using Snowflake Streams, reducing unnecessary compute and improving efficiency.

###✅ Idempotent Data Loads

MERGE operations ensure rerunning the pipeline does not introduce duplicate records.

###✅ Historical Data Preservation

SCD Type-2 dimensions maintain complete business history, supporting accurate point-in-time analysis.

###✅ Automated Orchestration

Snowflake Tasks coordinate ingestion, validation, transformation, and analytical refreshes without manual intervention.

### Data Quality by Design

A dedicated validation framework separates trusted business data from rejected records while maintaining comprehensive audit logs.

##⚙️ Enterprise Data Pipeline

Retail360 is built as a fully automated, event-driven data platform where every stage of the pipeline is designed to be modular, scalable, and resilient. Instead of relying on external orchestration tools, the platform leverages native Snowflake capabilities to manage ingestion, transformation, validation, orchestration, and analytics.

The pipeline follows a layered approach where each component has a clearly defined responsibility, enabling maintainability, observability, and reliable data processing.

##📥 Data Ingestion Layer

The ingestion layer is responsible for continuously importing retail datasets into Snowflake while preserving source fidelity.

Incoming business data is uploaded to Snowflake Internal Stages in multiple formats including CSV, JSON, and Parquet. Snowpipe continuously monitors these stages and automatically ingests newly arrived files without requiring manual execution.

###Key Responsibilities
Continuous file ingestion
Multi-format file support
Automatic schema mapping
Metadata capture
Source preservation
Incremental loading

###Snowflake Components Used
```text
Component	Purpose
Internal Stage	Stores incoming retail datasets
File Formats	Parses CSV, JSON and Parquet files
Snowpipe	Automatically ingests newly uploaded files
Raw Tables	Stores immutable source records
```

##🌊 Change Data Capture (CDC)

After data lands in the RAW layer, Snowflake Streams detect incremental changes made to the source tables.

Instead of processing the entire dataset repeatedly, only newly inserted or modified records are forwarded for validation and transformation. This significantly improves performance and reduces compute costs.

Benefits
Incremental processing
Lower warehouse utilization
Faster execution
Event-driven architecture
No duplicate processing
🧹 Data Quality Framework

One of the core objectives of Retail360 is ensuring that downstream analytics are built on trusted data.

Every incoming record passes through a comprehensive validation framework before entering the warehouse.

Unlike traditional ETL pipelines that reject an entire batch because of a few invalid records, Retail360 isolates only the problematic rows while allowing valid records to continue processing.

This design improves reliability without interrupting business operations.

Validation Rules

The platform validates:

Mandatory field completeness
Data type consistency
Date format validation
Negative revenue detection
Invalid quantities
Duplicate business keys
Missing customer references
Missing product references
Invalid status values
Business rule compliance
🚫 Reject Framework

Invalid records are never discarded silently.

Instead, every rejected record is redirected into dedicated reject tables together with detailed validation information.

This allows developers and business users to investigate data quality issues without impacting operational reporting.

Reject Framework Components
Component	Purpose
Reject Tables	Stores invalid records
Reject Log	Captures validation errors
Error Messages	Explains rejection reason
Audit Timestamp	Tracks processing time

🔄 Stored Procedure Framework

Business transformations are encapsulated within modular stored procedures.

Each procedure performs a specific responsibility, making the platform easier to maintain, extend, and test.

Typical responsibilities include:

Data validation
Cleansing
Standardization
Dimension loading
Fact loading
Merge logic
Audit logging

This modular approach promotes code reuse while reducing operational complexity.

⏰ Automated Workflow Orchestration

Retail360 uses Snowflake Tasks to automate the complete data pipeline.

Each task executes only after its upstream dependency has completed successfully, ensuring reliable end-to-end processing.

🏢 Enterprise Data Warehouse

The Core Warehouse represents the trusted source of truth for analytical reporting.

The warehouse follows a Star Schema design consisting of optimized fact and dimension tables that support high-performance analytical queries.

Dimension Tables

Examples include:

Customer
Product
Store
Date
Employee

These dimensions preserve historical business changes using Type-2 Slowly Changing Dimensions.

Fact Tables

Fact tables capture measurable business events such as:

Sales
Orders
Revenue
Inventory
Transactions

Each fact record references dimension tables, enabling consistent analytical reporting.

📜 Type-2 Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD2)

Retail360 maintains historical versions of dimensional entities using the SCD Type-2 methodology.

Rather than overwriting records, changes create new versions while preserving historical information.

For example:

Customer	City	Current
Alice	Bangalore	No
Alice	Mumbai	Yes

This enables accurate point-in-time reporting and trend analysis.

Benefits
Historical tracking
Auditability
Business lineage
Time-travel analytics
